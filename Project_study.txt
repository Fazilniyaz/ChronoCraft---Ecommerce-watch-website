1. React -Async - Helmet :

	Integration : 
		
		Install npm i react-async-helmet
		Import <HelmetProvider> in App.js
		Cover the entire App component with <HelmetProvider/>
		We wont use helmet in  all components instead we create one helmet component and use it where ever we want.
		So that In out project , we had created a File named a MetaData.js and used it wherever we want.


2. Redux :

	-> Product listing
	-> Product detail with state.
	-> Show Loading.
	-> Error alert.


# Create a file named store.js adjacent to index.js .

# There we need to setup the store with Combined Reducers and ConfiguredStore.

# Create a file named productsSlice.js. Here use a CreateSlice({}) to create product slices with initial values and Reducers in it.

# In our project we have used productsRequest , productsSuccess , productsFail actions .

# In our index.js, import Provider, store and cover the App with them.


# Create a file named productsAction.js. from theere only we will execute API calls and dispatch the actions in productsSlice.js with some data.
	
	example : export const getProducts = async(dispatch) => { try {
		  dispatch(productRequest())
		  const {data} = await axios.get("/api/v1/")...
		  dispatch(productSuccess(data))
# Now if you want to display products inn Home then we need to execute/dispatch the getProducts function frpm productAction.js.
# So that in Home.js we will dispatch getProducts in Home.js.

	Home.js :
  
	const dispatch = useDispatch();
	useEffect(()=>{
		dispatch(getProducts)	
	},[])

# Now it will set the products detailsn in redux . so that you cabn see the api showing 200 status in network tab.

# Now all the datas are setted in redux , to fetch those datas we need to use useselector in the Home component.

# What is there was a error while fetching data. to hanlde it we will use try catch block.

-> npm i "react-toastify"

-> import ToastContainer

#  Place the ToastContainer in the App.jsx. so that all the components can able to accees athe toastcontainer and can show the custom error message popup.

# This is how the react redux works in our project. 

# Then if you want to show more than one image. then use carousel.

# For using carousel, -> npm I react-bootstrap@1.x

# Now use the Carousel component whereever you want. For example in ProductDetail.js:

	import {Carousel} from 'react-bootstrap';
	
	 <Carousel pause="hover">
                {product.images &&
                  product.images.length > 0 &&
                  product.images.map((image) => (
                    <Carousel.Item key={image._id}>
                      <img
                        className="d-block w-100"
                        src={image.image}
                        alt={product.name}
                        height="500"
                        width="500"
                      />
                    </Carousel.Item>
                  ))}
              </Carousel>




Tips and tricks:

1. If you are using ObjectId or token something kike that in your api. then use useParams() hook.
2. If you need to fetch the data from the redux the use useSelector hook.
3. If you need to dispatch a change or action in redux then use useDispatch() hook.
4. Need to provide proper dependencies in the useEffect
